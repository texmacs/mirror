  <tmdoc-title|Advanced table features>

  In the menus, you also find some other more special features for tables.
  Very briefly, these include the following:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Change the \Pspan\Q of a cell and let it run over its neighbouring
    cells on its right and below.

    <item>Creation of entire subtables inside cells.

    <item>Correction of the depth and height of text, in order to let the
    baselines match.

    <item>Horizontal hyphenation of cell contents and vertical hyphenation of
    the entire table.

    <item>Gluing several rows and/or columns together, so that the glued
    cells become \Ppart of the borders\Q of the remaining cells.

    <item>Deactivation of the table, in order to see its \Psource code\Q.

    <item>Setting the \Pextension center\Q of a table. From now on, the
    formatting properties of this cell will be used for new cells created
    around this center.

    <item>Specification of the minimal and maximum size of a table, which
    will be respected during further editing. (this is mainly useful when
    creating table macros).
  </itemize>

  Currently, all tables come inside an environment like <markup|tabular>,
  <markup|block>, <markup|matrix>, etc. When creating your own table macros,
  you may use <menu|Table|Special table properties|Extract format> to extract
  the format from a given table.
