    <expand|item*|Fonts.>

    The <apply|TeXmacs> program uses professional <apply|TeX> fonts. When you
    launch the program for the first time, many of these fonts may have to be
    generated, which may significantly slow down the editor. Keep cool: each
    font needs only to be generated once. At\ 

    <\verbatim>
      \ \ \ \ ftp://ftp.texmacs.org/pub/TeXmacs/Fonts.html
    </verbatim>

    you may also find some instructions about how to download some
    pregenerated fonts.
