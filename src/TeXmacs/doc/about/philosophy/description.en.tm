  <tmdoc-title|A short description of GNU <TeXmacs>>

  GNU <TeXmacs> is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing
  platform with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide
  a unified and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with
  different types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive
  content, <abbr|etc.>). The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting
  algorithms so as to produce professionally looking documents, which can
  either be printed out or presented from a laptop.

  The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical formulas,
  a small technical picture editor and a tool for making presentations from a
  laptop. Moreover, <TeXmacs> can be used as an interface for many external
  systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics,<nbsp>etc. New
  presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
  added to the editor using the <name|Scheme> extension language. A native
  spreadsheet and tools for collaborative authoring are planned for later.

  <TeXmacs> runs on GNU/<name|Linux>, <name|MacOS>, and <name|Windows>.
  Documents can be saved in <TeXmacs>, <name|Xml> or <name|Scheme> format and
  printed as <name|Postscript> or <name|Pdf> files. Although <TeXmacs> is
  <em|not> based on <TeX>/<LaTeX>, high quality converters exist for <LaTeX>.
  Documents can also be exported to <name|Html>/<name|Mathml> for publication
  on the web.
