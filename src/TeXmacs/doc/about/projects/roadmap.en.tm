  <tmdoc-title|Roadmap for upcoming developments>

  It is difficult to give a precise roadmap for the <TeXmacs> development,
  because our plans are permanently adjusted as a function of unexpected
  needs, help by new contributors and personal moods. Nevertheless, we tend
  to spend a significant time on a few major objectives, while amusing
  ourselves with the implementation of a few new features. Roughly speaking,
  our roadmap can therefore be divided into three major parts:

  <\enumerate>
    <item>A limited number of major objectives for the upcoming stable
    versions (2.1 and 2.2).

    <item>A certain number of minor objectives, subject to continuous
    changes, and which progress as a function of available time.

    <item>Other projects, which are developed by external contributors, but
    which occasionnaly require changes in the <TeXmacs> core.
  </enumerate>
