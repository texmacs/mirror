  <tmdoc-title|The <TeXmacs> plug-in system>

  There are many ways in which <TeXmacs> can be customized or extended: users
  may define their own style files, customize the user interface, or write
  links with extern programs. The plug-in system provides a universal
  mechanism to combine one or several such extensions in a single package.
  Plug-ins are both easy to install by other users and easy to write and
  maintain.
