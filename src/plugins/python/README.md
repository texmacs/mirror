## Installation
Python is a built-in plugin in GNU TeXmacs.
Sometimes, the built-in one does not work or does not meet your requirement.
You may install the latest or the specific version of the plugin manually
to `$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins`. The plugin under `$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH` will
override the system one.

For GNU/Linux and macOS:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:texmacs/python.git $HOME/.TeXmacs/plugins/python
```

For Windows:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:texmacs/python.git %APPDATA%\TeXmacs\plugins\python
```

To switch to a specific version, use `git checkout` or modify it manually.

## Change the Python Interpreter
Install the Python plugin to `$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins` and then change
the python launcher in `$TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/python/progs/init-python.scm`.

If you have permissions for `$TEXMACS_PATH/plugins/python/progs/init-python.scm`, you may also change the system one.

Here is the detailed example of changing the python command:

``` scheme
(define (python-command) "python3")
```

By default, we use `python3`. To use a specific python version, just change the return value of the `(python-commond)` function.

``` scheme
(define (python-command) "/path/to/python")
```
