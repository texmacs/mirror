Qt port notes
-------------

* Image support is still partial. In particular System/Files/image_files.cpp 
  should be modified to allow the ue of Qt to gather informations on image sizes.
  On Mac we can use the Apple Distiller instead of ghostscript to interpret pdf 
  and ps images. (What about Windows?)

* wait_widget seems do not belong to the abstract interface 
  (it is not called in texmacs code)  
  
* due to limitation of Qt/Mac multiple keyboard shortcuts in the menu bar
  are not correctly displayed. Need more work...

* Paint interrupts can be enabled by uncommenting code in check_event.
  However, this requires drawing to a shadow buffer.
  This should be tested on an old computer when repainting is slow.
  On fast computers, paint interrupts are no longer essential.

* We temporary need to add the_gui->update (); after some of the event handlers,
  because the current implementation of edit_typeset_rep::get_env_value
  is too slow in cases of high speed typing (for instance).
  Ideally, it should be possible to treat several events at once,
  without interspersing calls to update, since this will relieve
  the typesetter. This requires an efficient treatment of events
  in non-updated states.
