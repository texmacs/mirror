*** Changes of July 2024 for version guile-texmacs-1.8.8

Adding system.h and system.c: The guile code is old and may not work
directly on newer systems. To accommodate this, users have the possibility to
create hooks for the system functions (such as fstat, fopen, ...). The Guile
functions will always call the corresponding hooks if they are defined.
