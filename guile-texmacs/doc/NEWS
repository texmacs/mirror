Changes since Guile 1.3.4:

* It's now possible to build HTML documentation as well as Info

The guile-doc distribution now supports building HTML versions of the
Guile tutorial and reference manual, in addition to the standard Info
documentation.  To enable this, include the `--enable-html' option
when you run `./configure':

     ./configure --enable-html

HTML documentation is installed in $(prefix)/html/guile-$(VERSION).


Changes since Guile 1.0 (Sun 5 Jan 1997):

* The current documentation approach, recommended by Jim Blandy, is to
have: (*) a tutorial with the pedagogical style of guile-user, and a
non-dry reference manual in the style of the most excellent GNU libc
reference manual: the reference manual should be complete, but at the
same time it should have an introductory screen for each major topic,
which can be referenced if the user goes "up" a level in the info
documentation.
