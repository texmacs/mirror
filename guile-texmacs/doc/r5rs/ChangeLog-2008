	* r5rs.texi: Use @ifnottex instead of @ifinfo around the "Top"
	node declaration so that html can be generated.  Use only lower
	case inside @sc.  Move editors outside of author table, which
	looks better in html.

	* Makefile.am (TEXINFO_TEX): Added; avoids shipping multiple copies of
	texinfo.tex in a single distribution.

	The change log for files in this directory continues backwards
	from 2001-08-27 in ../ChangeLog, as all the Guile documentation
	prior to this date was contained in a single directory.
