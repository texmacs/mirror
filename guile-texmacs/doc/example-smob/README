This is the example code for the ``Defining New Types (Smobs)''
chapter of the Guile manual.

When you try to execute the code, if the system complains that it
can't find libguile.so, you need to add the directory containing the
installed Guile libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
