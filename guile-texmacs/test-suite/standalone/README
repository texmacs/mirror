These tests use the standard automake TESTS mechanism.  Tests should
be listed in TESTS in Makefile.am, and should exit with 0 on success,
non-zero on failure, and 77 if the result should be ignored.  See the
automake info pages for more information.

If you want to use a scheme script, prefix it as follows:

  #!/bin/sh
  exec guile -s "$0" "$@"
  !#

Makefile.am will arrange for all tests (scripts or executables) to be
run under pre-inst-guile-env so that the PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and
GUILE_LOAD_PATH will be augmented appropriately.

The Makefile.am has an example of creating a shared library to be used
from a test scheme script as well.

You can also create standalone executables that include your own code,
are linked against libguile, and that run a given test script (or
scripts).  One way to do this is to create the binary, make sure it
calls scm_shell (argc, argv) as its final action, and put this bit at
the top of your test script:

  #!./my-test-binary -s
  !#
