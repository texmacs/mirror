;;;; CORE FUNCTIONS
;;;;
;;;; The function (run-test name expected-result thunk) is the heart of the
;;;; testing environment.  The first parameter NAME is a unique name for the
;;;; test to be executed (for an explanation of this parameter see below under
;;;; TEST NAMES).  The second parameter EXPECTED-RESULT is a boolean value
;;;; that indicates whether the corresponding test is expected to pass.  If
;;;; EXPECTED-RESULT is #t the test is expected to pass, if EXPECTED-RESULT is
;;;; #f the test is expected to fail.  Finally, THUNK is the function that
;;;; actually performs the test.  For example:
;;;;
;;;;    (run-test "integer addition" #t (lambda () (= 2 (+ 1 1))))
;;;;
;;;; To report success, THUNK should either return #t or throw 'pass.  To
;;;; report failure, THUNK should either return #f or throw 'fail.  If THUNK
;;;; returns a non boolean value or throws 'unresolved, this indicates that
;;;; the test did not perform as expected.  For example the property that was
;;;; to be tested could not be tested because something else went wrong.
;;;; THUNK may also throw 'untested to indicate that the test was deliberately
;;;; not performed, for example because the test case is not complete yet.
;;;; Finally, if THUNK throws 'unsupported, this indicates that this test
;;;; requires some feature that is not available in the configured testing
;;;; environment.  All other exceptions thrown by THUNK are considered as
;;;; errors.
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; Convenience macros for tests expected to pass or fail
;;;;
;;;; * (pass-if name body) is a short form for
;;;;   (run-test name #t (lambda () body))
;;;; * (expect-fail name body) is a short form for
;;;;   (run-test name #f (lambda () body))
;;;;
;;;; For example:
;;;;
;;;;    (pass-if "integer addition" (= 2 (+ 1 1)))
;;;;
;;;;
;;;; Convenience macros to test for exceptions
;;;;
;;;; The following macros take exception parameters which are pairs
;;;; (type . message), where type is a symbol that denotes an exception type
;;;; like 'wrong-type-arg or 'out-of-range, and message is a string holding a
;;;; regular expression that describes the error message for the exception
;;;; like "Argument .* out of range".
;;;;
;;;; * (pass-if-exception name exception body) will pass if the execution of
;;;;   body causes the given exception to be thrown.  If no exception is
;;;;   thrown, the test fails.  If some other exception is thrown, is is an
;;;;   error.
;;;; * (expect-fail-exception name exception body) will pass unexpectedly if
;;;;   the execution of body causes the given exception to be thrown.  If no
;;;;   exception is thrown, the test fails expectedly.  If some other
;;;;   exception is thrown, it is an error.


;;;; TEST NAMES
;;;;
;;;; Every test in the test suite has a unique name, to help
;;;; developers find tests that are failing (or unexpectedly passing),
;;;; and to help gather statistics.
;;;;
;;;; A test name is a list of printable objects.  For example:
;;;; ("ports.scm" "file" "read and write back list of strings")
;;;; ("ports.scm" "pipe" "read")
;;;;
;;;; Test names may contain arbitrary objects, but they always have
;;;; the following properties:
;;;; - Test names can be compared with EQUAL?.
;;;; - Test names can be reliably stored and retrieved with the standard WRITE
;;;;   and READ procedures; doing so preserves their identity.
;;;;
;;;; For example:
;;;;
;;;;    (pass-if "simple addition" (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
;;;;
;;;; In that case, the test name is the list ("simple addition").
;;;;
;;;; In the case of simple tests the expression that is tested would often
;;;; suffice as a test name by itself.  Therefore, the convenience macros
;;;; pass-if and expect-fail provide a shorthand notation that allows to omit
;;;; a test name in such cases.
;;;;
;;;; * (pass-if expression) is a short form for
;;;;   (run-test 'expression #t (lambda () expression))
;;;; * (expect-fail expression) is a short form for
;;;;   (run-test 'expression #f (lambda () expression))
;;;;
;;;; For example:
;;;;
;;;;    (pass-if (= 2 (+ 1 1)))
;;;;
;;;; The WITH-TEST-PREFIX syntax and WITH-TEST-PREFIX* procedure establish
;;;; a prefix for the names of all tests whose results are reported
;;;; within their dynamic scope.  For example:
;;;;
;;;; (begin
;;;;   (with-test-prefix "basic arithmetic"
;;;;     (pass-if "addition" (= (+ 2 2) 4))
;;;;     (pass-if "subtraction" (= (- 4 2) 2)))
;;;;   (pass-if "multiplication" (= (* 2 2) 4)))
;;;;
;;;; In that example, the three test names are:
;;;;   ("basic arithmetic" "addition"),
;;;;   ("basic arithmetic" "subtraction"), and
;;;;   ("multiplication").
;;;;
;;;; WITH-TEST-PREFIX can be nested.  Each WITH-TEST-PREFIX postpends
;;;; a new element to the current prefix:
;;;;
;;;; (with-test-prefix "arithmetic"
;;;;   (with-test-prefix "addition"
;;;;     (pass-if "integer" (= (+ 2 2) 4))
;;;;     (pass-if "complex" (= (+ 2+3i 4+5i) 6+8i)))
;;;;   (with-test-prefix "subtraction"
;;;;     (pass-if "integer" (= (- 2 2) 0))
;;;;     (pass-if "complex" (= (- 2+3i 1+2i) 1+1i))))
;;;;
;;;; The four test names here are:
;;;;   ("arithmetic" "addition" "integer")
;;;;   ("arithmetic" "addition" "complex")
;;;;   ("arithmetic" "subtraction" "integer")
;;;;   ("arithmetic" "subtraction" "complex")
;;;;
;;;; To print a name for a human reader, we DISPLAY its elements,
;;;; separated by ": ".  So, the last set of test names would be
;;;; reported as:
;;;;
;;;;   arithmetic: addition: integer
;;;;   arithmetic: addition: complex
;;;;   arithmetic: subtraction: integer
;;;;   arithmetic: subtraction: complex
;;;;
;;;; The Guile benchmarks use with-test-prefix to include the name of
;;;; the source file containing the test in the test name, to help
;;;; developers to find failing tests, and to provide each file with its
;;;; own namespace.


;;;; REPORTERS
;;;;
;;;; A reporter is a function which we apply to each test outcome.
;;;; Reporters can log results, print interesting results to the
;;;; standard output, collect statistics, etc.
;;;;
;;;; A reporter function takes two mandatory arguments, RESULT and TEST, and
;;;; possibly additional arguments depending on RESULT; its return value
;;;; is ignored.  RESULT has one of the following forms:
;;;;
;;;; pass         - The test named TEST passed.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; upass        - The test named TEST passed unexpectedly.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; fail         - The test named TEST failed.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; xfail        - The test named TEST failed, as expected.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; unresolved   - The test named TEST did not perform as expected, for
;;;;                example the property that was to be tested could not be
;;;;                tested because something else went wrong.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; untested     - The test named TEST was not actually performed, for
;;;;                example because the test case is not complete yet.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; unsupported  - The test named TEST requires some feature that is not
;;;;                available in the configured testing environment.
;;;;                Additional arguments are ignored.
;;;; error        - An error occurred while the test named TEST was
;;;;                performed.  Since this result means that the system caught
;;;;                an exception it could not handle, the exception arguments
;;;;                are passed as additional arguments.
;;;;
;;;; This library provides some standard reporters for logging results
;;;; to a file, reporting interesting results to the user, and
;;;; collecting totals.
;;;;
;;;; You can use the REGISTER-REPORTER function and friends to add
;;;; whatever reporting functions you like.  If you don't register any
;;;; reporters, the library uses FULL-REPORTER, which simply writes
;;;; all results to the standard output.
