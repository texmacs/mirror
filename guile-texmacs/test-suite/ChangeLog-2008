	leaking out of syntax.test).

2006-09-20  Ludovic Courtès  <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>

	* tests/srfi-9.test: More tests, in particular check for exceptions on

	implement the latter.  Reported by Claes Wallin.

	invert the sense of exit statuses, as the latter doesn't work on

2001-08-09  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Do not call the variable "TESTS", call it
	"SCM_TESTS".  This has special meaning to automake.  How many
	tries left to get this right, mvo?

2001-08-08  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): List tests explicitely instead of using a

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (exception:unbound-var, exception:wrong-num-args):  New
	exported constants.

	* tests/r4rs.test:  Make sure that no bindings for x and y exist
	after the file is loaded.

	* tests/syntax.test:  New file.

	from tests/exceptions.test to tests/syntax.test.  Moved tests
	related to evaluation and application to tests/eval.test.

	exception handling.

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	related test cases from tests/exceptions.test to

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/symbols.test:  New file.

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

	* tests/exceptions.test, tests/strings.test, tests/symbols.test:
	Moved the string related test cases from tests/exceptions.test to
	tests/strings.test and the symbol related test cases to
	tests/symbols.test.

	* tests/strings.test:  Copyright notice updated.  Added a couple

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

2001-02-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/exceptions.test:  Use expect-fail-exception to indicate
	test cases where exceptions should occur, but don't.

	* lib.scm:  Added comment about new convenience functions/macros
	to test for exceptions.

	(exception:out-of-range, exception:wrong-type-arg):  New exported
	constants.

	(run-test-exception):  New function.

	(catch-error-returning-true, pass-if-not,
	catch-error-returning-false):  Removed.  The macro pass-if-not was
	not used.  The macro catch-error-returning-false is unnecessary
	since exceptions are caught by the test-suite anyway.  The
	functionality of catch-error-returning-true is provided by the new
	convenience macro pass-if-exception.

	* tests/hooks.test (exception:wrong-num-hook-args):  New constant.
	Maybe a standard wrong-num-arg exception should be thrown instead
	of a misc-error?

	* tests/reader.test (try-to-read):  Replaced by read-string.

	(read-string):  New function.

	* tests/alist.test, tests/environments.test, tests/eval.test,

	tests/reader.test, tests/strings.test, tests/weaks.test:  Replace
	tests for exceptions with the new convenience macros.

	* tests/alist.test:  Remove redundant test name prefix.

2001-02-28  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* lib.scm (pass-if):  Tests shall return a boolean value.

	(documented?), tests/environments.test (documented?),
	tests/eval.test (documented?), tests/gc.test (documented?),
	tests/numbers.test (documented?), tests/guardians.test,
	tests/hooks.test, tests/interp.test, tests/weaks.test:  Make sure
	that tests return a boolean value.

2001-02-08  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* guile-test: Use (ice-9 and-let-star) instead of (ice-9
	and-let*).

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	This patch fixes things that I have broken with the last one :-(

	* guile-test (test-suite):  New variable.

	(data-file-name):  New function.  Has the same purpose as the
	former function data-file from lib.scm.  Moved here in order to
	have all file name handling at the same place.  In contrast to the
	former 'data-file function, it is not checked whether a file
	exists.  This allows to use this function also for file names of
	files that are still to be created.

	(test-file-name):  Use the global 'test-suite variable.

	(main):  Initialize 'test-suite instead of a local variable.

	* lib.scm:  Don't import paths any more.

	(data-file):  Removed.  Resurrected with a sligtly different
	functionality as 'data-file-name' in guile-test.

	* r4rs.scm:  For all references to temporary file, make use of
	data-file-name.

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	The following patch was sent by Thien-Thi Nguyen and a little bit
	modified by me.

	* guile-test:  Usage and installation comments improved.  Added
	support for --test-suite and --debug command line options.

	(default-test-suite):  Added to allow for simplified
	configurability.  No need to load the paths file any more.

	(enable-debug-mode):  New function.  Will be called when the
	--debug command line option is given.

	(test-root):  Removed.  The test directory has to be fully given.
	This allows for arbitrarily named test directories.

	(test-file-name, enumerate-tets):  Take the test directory as a
	paramter instead of using the global variable 'test-root'.

	(main):  Handle the new command line options.  Return an exit code
	depending on whether all tests came out as expected.

	* README:  Updated.

	* paths.scm:  Removed.

2001-01-24  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test: include (ice-9 rdelim) module.

2000-09-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/strings.test:  Added a test to help remember that string=?
	and friends need fixing.

2000-09-12  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  For tests that rely on garbage
	collection, conservative scanning can be a problem.  Add a comment
	for these tests and make them turn out unresolved if things don't
	work as expected.

2000-09-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  Finished and cleaned up the tests for
	the leaf environments.  Added a complete set of testcases for the
	leaf environment based eval environments.  Started with the tests
	for the import environments.

2000-08-25  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  Added.

2000-08-21  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/list.test, tests/numbers.test:  Added.

2000-05-08  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* guile-test:  Eliminate use of catch-test-errors.

	* lib.scm:  Adopted a couple of nice ideas from Greg.

	(pass, fail, expect-failure, expect-failure-if,
	expect-failure-if*, catch-test-errors, catch-test-errors*,
	expected-failure-fluid, pessimist?):  Removed.

	(run-test, expect-fail, result-tags, important-result-tags):
	Added.

	(report, make-count-reporter, print-counts, make-log-reporter,
	full-reporter, user-reporter):  Reporters take two mandatory
	arguments and make use of the tag descriptions in result-tags and
	important-result-tags.

	* tests/alist.test, tests/hooks.test, tests/ports.test,
	tests/weaks.test:  Don't use catch-test-errors and
	expect-failure-if.

	* mambo.test:  Removed dummy file.

2000-03-31  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test (non-blocking-I/O): a couple more details:
	a) combine the O_NONBLOCK flag with the default flags instead
	of replacing them.  b) check EWOULDBLOCK as well as EAGAIN.

2000-03-22  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* lib.scm: Doc fixes.

Sun Jan 16 14:01:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* paths.scm: Assume that ~/guile-core/test-suite is the location
	of the test suite now.

	* tests/version.test: Added -- version.c had 0% coverage before,
	now at 100%.

	* tests/chars.test: Added -- needed test of char-is-both?.

1999-12-22  Greg Harvey <Greg.Harvey@thezone.net>

	* tests/c-api.test: Refine the list of files that are checked in
	the seek-offset-test.  Was just using files that end in "c", but
	that caught the new ".doc" files, too, so make sure that files end
	in ".c" before requiring that they include unistd.h if they
	reference SEEK_(SET|CUR|END).

	an input string and seeking an output string.

	properly.

1999-09-20  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test: Check that our input functions cope when
	current-input-port is closed.

	* tests/regexp.test: Check regexp-substitute/global when there are
	no matches.  (Duh.)

1999-09-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

1999-08-01  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/r4rs.test (SECTION 3 4): Each element of type-matrix
	corresponds to an example object, not a predicate.  Aubrey
	probably never noticed this because SCM doesn't check the lengths
	of the arguments to for-each and map...

	* tests/ports.test: Add some regression tests for char-ready?.

1999-07-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/interp.test: New file.

1999-06-15  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/time.test: New test file.

	* tests/r4rs.test: New set of tests, taken from Guile's test
	script, taken from SCM.

	* tests/ports.test: Group the string port tests under a new
	test name prefix.

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Check the final column, too.

	* lib.scm: Import (test-suite paths).

1999-06-12  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Add test for correct column
	at EOF.

1999-06-09  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Verify that we do eventually
	get EOF on the port --- don't just read forever.

	* lib.scm (full-reporter): The test name is the cadr of the
	result, not the cdr.  I'm not macho enough to handle run-time
	typechecking.

	* lib.scm (print-counts): XFAILS are "expected failures", not
	"unexpected failures."

	* lib.scm, guile-test, paths.scm: Log begins.
