Aubrey Jaffer:
is the author of SCM, the Scheme interpreter upon which Guile is
based.  Guile started from SCM version 4e1 in November -94 and is
still largely composed of the original SCM code.

George Carrette:
wrote files present in Siod version 2.3, released in December of 1989.
Siod was the starting point for SCM.  The major innovations taken from
Siod are the evaluator's use of the C-stack and being able to garbage
collect off the C-stack

The file libguile/gc_os_dep.c is from the Boehm-Weiser conservative
collector.  A lot of people have contributed to it, but probably not
all to the code in gc_os_dep.c:

    The SPARC specific code was contributed by Mark Weiser
    (weiser@parc.xerox.com).  The Encore Multimax modifications were
    supplied by Kevin Kenny (kenny@m.cs.uiuc.edu).  The adaptation to
    the RT is largely due to Vernon Lee (scorpion@rice.edu), on
    machines made available by IBM.  Much of the HP specific code and
    a number of good suggestions for improving the generic code are
    due to Walter Underwood (wunder@hp-ses.sde.hp.com).  Robert
    Brazile (brazile@diamond.bbn.com) originally supplied the ULTRIX
    code.  Al Dosser (dosser@src.dec.com) and Regis Cridlig
    (Regis.Cridlig@cl.cam.ac.uk) subsequently provided updates and
    information on variation between ULTRIX systems.  Parag Patel
    (parag@netcom.com) supplied the A/UX code.  Jesper
    Peterson(jep@mtiame.mtia.oz.au), Michel Schinz, and Martin
    Tauchmann (martintauchmann@bigfoot.com) supplied the Amiga port.
    Thomas Funke (thf@zelator.in-berlin.de(?)) and Brian D.Carlstrom
    (bdc@clark.lcs.mit.edu) supplied the NeXT ports.  Douglas Steel
    (doug@wg.icl.co.uk) provided ICL DRS6000 code.  Bill Janssen
    (janssen@parc.xerox.com) supplied the SunOS dynamic loader
    specific code. Manuel Serrano (serrano@cornas.inria.fr) supplied
    linux and Sony News specific code.  Al Dosser provided Alpha/OSF/1
    code.  He and Dave Detlefs(detlefs@src.dec.com) also provided
    several generic bug fixes.  Alistair G. Crooks(agc@uts.amdahl.com)
    supplied the NetBSD and 386BSD ports.  Jeffrey Hsu
    (hsu@soda.berkeley.edu) provided the FreeBSD port.  Brent Benson
    (brent@jade.ssd.csd.harris.com) ported the collector to a Motorola
    88K processor running CX/UX (Harris NightHawk).  Ari Huttunen
    (Ari.Huttunen@hut.fi) generalized the OS/2 port to nonIBM
    development environments (a nontrivial task).  Patrick Beard
    (beard@cs.ucdavis.edu) provided the initial MacOS port.  David
    Chase, then at Olivetti Research, suggested several improvements.
    Scott Schwartz (schwartz@groucho.cse.psu.edu) supplied some of the
    code to save and print call stacks for leak detection on a SPARC.
    Jesse Hull and John Ellis supplied the C++ interface code.  Zhong
    Shao performed much of the experimentation that led to the current
    typed allocation facility.  (His dynamic type inference code
    hasn't made it into the released version of the collector, yet.)
    (Blame for misinstallation of these modifications goes to the
    first author, however.)
