This directory contains various bits of Guile Scheme code.
Most of these are packaged as modules, with foo.scm implementing
the module `(ice-9 foo)'.

The non-module files are:

boot-9.scm	-- loaded on guile startup
		   implements module system + lots of other stuff
arrays.scm	-- loaded by boot-9.scm
networking.scm	-- loaded by boot-9.scm
posix.scm	-- loaded by boot-9.scm
r4rs.scm	-- loaded by boot-9.scm
