* Overview

This directory includes examples which show how to write and use Guile
modules in Scheme programs.

The descriptions below assume that you have a working copy of Guile
installed and available with the standard installation prefix
`/usr/local'.


* Included Examples


** main

  The main program, which uses the modules described below to perform
  some actions.  Module usage and selective importing as well as
  renaming is demonstrated here.n

  $ ./main

  or

  guile -s main

** module-0.scm, module-1.scm, module-2.scm
 
  Two modules which export several procedure, some of which have the
  same names (so that renaming/selection is required for proper
  importing).
