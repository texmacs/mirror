* Overview

This directory contains examples illustrating various aspects of Guile
programming.

If you plan writing Scheme programs, have a look at the `scripts'
directory.  To learn more about Guile modules, check out the `modules'
directory, and maybe the `box-module' and `box-dynamic-module'
directories, if you are into C programming or shared libraries,
respectively.  The `safe' directory contains examples for evaluation
Scheme code in controlled environments (sandboxing).  The directories
`box', `box-module', `box-dynamic' and `box-dynamic-module' are
interesting if you plan writing Guile extensions.

See the README files in the subdirectories for details.


* Included Examples

scripts             Examples for writing simple scripts in Guile Scheme.

box		    Example for extending Guile with a new data type.

box-module	    Similar to `box', but defines new procedures in a
		    named module.
box-dynamic	    Implements the box type in a dynamically loadable
		    library.
box-dynamic-module  Combination of `box-module' and `box-dynamic': 
		    Implements the `box' type in a shared library and
		    defines the procedures in a Guile module.

modules		    Examples for writing and using Guile modules.

safe		    Examples for creating and using safe environments.

compat		    autoconf code for making a Guile extension
		    compatible with older versions of Guile.
