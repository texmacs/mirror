This directory contains some benchmarks for Guile, and some generic
benchmarking support code.

To run these benchmarks, you will need a version of Guile more recent
than 15 Feb 1999 --- the benchmarks use the (ice-9 and-let*) and
(ice-9 getopt-long) modules, which were added to Guile around then.

For information about how to run the benchmark suite, read the usage
instructions in the comments at the top of the guile-benchmark script.

You can reference the file `lib.scm' from your own code as the module
(benchmark-suite lib); it also has comments at the top and before each
function explaining what's going on.

Please write more Guile benchmarks, and send them to bug-guile@gnu.org.
We'll merge them into the distribution.  All benchmark suites must be
licensed for our use under the GPL, but I don't think we're going to
collect assignment papers for them.
