## Commentary:

## This fragment defines two variables: preinstguile, preinstguiletool.
## It can be included in any Makefile.am by adding the line:
##   include $(top_srcdir)/am/pre-inst-guile
## See devel/build/pre-inst-guile.text (CVS only) for more info.

## Code:

preinstguile     = $(top_builddir_absolute)/pre-inst-guile
preinstguiletool = GUILE="$(preinstguile)" $(top_srcdir)/scripts

## am/pre-inst-guile ends here
