The gh implementation (gh_data.c, gh.h, etc.) used to live in a
separate directory called gh.  In April 1997, that dir was merged with
libguile; this is the ChangeLog from the old directory.

Please put new entries in the ordinary ChangeLog.

Thu Apr 10 16:14:43 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Let the test programs build even when we're not using threads.
	* configure.in: Use CY_AC_WITH_THREADS to decide whether to build
	with threads.
	* Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS_LDADD): Remove -lthreads -lqt.  The
	configure script will stick them in LIBS if they're needed.
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Rebuilt.

	* gh_funcs.c (gh_apply, gh_call0, gh_call1, gh_call2, gh_call3):
	New functions.
	* gh.h: Prototypes for above.
	* gh_test_c.c (main_prog): Added test cases for above.
	
	* gh.h (gh_display, gh_newline): Added prototypes.

	* gh_test_c.c (main_prog): Remove bizarre single quote from test
	of gh_symbol2scm, and from "test" of (display "hello world").

	* gh.c: Removed; its guts have been redistributed to the other
	gh-mumble.c files.

	* gh.c, gh_data.c, gh_eval.c, gh_funcs.c, gh_init.c, gh_io.c,
 	gh_list.c, gh_predicates.c, gh_test_c.c, gh_test_repl.c:
	Re-indented, according to the GNU coding standards.  (Put function
	names at beginning of lines, basically.)

Wed Apr  9 17:56:34 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Changes to work with automake-1.1n, which has better libtool support.
	* Makefile.am: Use lib_LTLIBRARIES, not lib_PROGRAMS.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Sat Mar  8 06:37:23 1997  Gary Houston  <ghouston@actrix.gen.nz>

	* gh_eval.c (gh_eval_file): remove case_i, sharp arguments from
	scm_primitive_load call.

Mon Feb 24 21:45:32 1997  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@mdj.nada.kth.se>

	* configure.in: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

Wed Feb 12 16:34:42 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_data.c (gh_symbol2newstr): added this conversion from SCM
 	symbol to C string.
	(gh_set_substr): more data conversion: from part of a (possibly
 	large) C string to an existing SCM string.
	(gh_get_substr): more data conversion: from part of a (possibly
	large) SCM string to an existing C char array.

Mon Feb 10 14:03:09 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_funcs.c (gh_define): added this function.

	* gh_init.c (gh_catch): fixed stupid bug, gh_catch() was not
 	returning anything.

	* gh_data.c (gh_scm2newstr): Renamed gh_scm2str0() to
	gh_scm2newstr(), and did away with the str0 convention (it doesn't
	seem to belong in gh_).
	(gh_scm2str): this function now copies Scheme data to a
	pre-allocated C string.

Fri Feb  7 15:12:30 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_data.c (gh_scm2str0): On Sascha Ziemann and Jim Blandy's
 	suggestion I changed gh_scm2str0() so that it returns a malloc-ed
 	string, rather than taking a pre-allocated string with a maximum
 	length...

Fri Jan 24 08:18:28 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* gh_eval.c (gh_eval_str): gh_eval_str() now returns an SCM object
	with the result of the evaluation.  It has also been simplified to
	just call scm_eval_0str().  gh_eval_file() has been similarly
	altered.

Sat Jan 11 14:40:17 1997  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* ltconfig, ltmain.sh: New files for libtool support. libguile,
 	rx, gh and gtcltk-lib can now be build as shared libraries.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added ltconfig and ltmain.sh

Sun Jan  5 16:57:10 1997  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Guile 1.0 released.  This is the first release by the Free
	Software Foundation; Cygnus has also released earlier versions of
	Guile.
	
	* GUILE-VERSION: Updated version number.
	* NEWS: Added comments for all the user-visible changes marked in
	the ChangeLogs.
	* README: Updated for release.

	doc/guile-user/Makefile.

Sat Nov 30 23:45:54 1996  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

 	configuration.
	
Fri Sep 13 14:39:30 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added mkinstalldirs to the DISTFILES

	* PLUGIN: changed the PLUGIN/REQ files in the ice-9 and lgh
	directories, to arrange for lgh to the last thing
	configured/built.

Wed Sep 11 21:11:33 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>

	* lgh/: added the directory in which I implement the high level
	libguile library (lgh_) for this release of Guile.  See the
	ChangeLog in there for further details.

Wed Sep 11 16:12:53 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@sarastro.lanl.gov>

	* doc/ (guile-user and guile-programmer): added the guile-user and
	guile-programmer directories which contain the user and programmer
	manuals.  See the ChangeLog entries there for detail.

Wed Sep 11 14:33:49 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't forget to delete doc/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't forget to delete
	config.build-subdirs.

Thu Sep  5 17:36:15 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (tags): New name for `TAGS' target, which will
	always run the commands.

Thu Sep  5 09:56:50 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* README: Doc fixes.

Fri Aug 30 16:56:27 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): Produce a single tags file for all of Guile.

Thu Aug 15 19:03:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -ldl, so the check for Tcl won't fail
 	spuriously.

Thu Aug 15 01:29:29 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	Change the way we decide whether to build gtcltk-lib, so that it's
	omitted from the build process when appropriate, but never from
	the dist process.
	* configure.in: Don't edit all_subdirs depending on the
 	availability of Tk; let that be the list of all PLUGIN
 	subdirectories present, as it used to be.  Instead, edit a new
 	variable, build_subdirs; write its final value, the list of
 	subdirs we do want to compile in, to config.build-subdirs.
  	Substitute that into the top-level Makefile too.
	* Makefile.in (subdirs): Set this to @build_subdirs@, so we only
	recurse on the subdirectories we should build.
	(distdirs): Set this to @existingdirs@, so it includes the subdirs
	we decided not to build.

	* doc/gtcltk.texi: File resurrected from old Guile releases.
	* doc/Makefile.in (info): Build the gtcltk documentation.
	(DIST_FILES): Include it in the distribution.

	* configure.in: If we can find the library for tcl7.5, build
 	gtcltk-lib.  Call AC_PROG_CC, to help run that test with the right
 	compiler (not sure this is necessary).

Mon Aug 12 15:09:37 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Fix bug reporting address.

Fri Aug  9 15:58:42 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* AUTHORS: New file, in accordance with the GNU maintainers'
 	standards.

Tue Aug  6 14:40:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* README: Renamed from ANNOUNCE; include bug report address,
	description, and short tour.
 	* INSTALL: Renamed from BUILDING.
	* NEWS: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Update appropriately.

Thu Aug  1 02:31:53 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* doc/Makefile.in: Added pattern targets for creating DVI and
	PostScript files.
	(%.ps, %.dvi, %.txt): New targets.
	(DVIPS, TEXI2DVI): New variables.

	* GUILE-VERSION: Updated to 1.0b3.

	Rehashed distribution system, in preparation for nightly
	snapshots.  Other changes in subdirectories.
	* Makefile.in (dist): Rewritten --- the old target was out of
 	date, dependent on files that we don't have, and relied on GNU
 	tar.  The new target is simpler.
	(VERSION, srcdir, dist_dirs): New variables.
	(DISTFILES): Renamed from localfiles.  Added GUILE-VERSION and
	TODO.
	(localtreats): Variable removed.  We don't have this file.
	(info): cd to doc and make info there; don't make info in every
	${subdir}; those Makefiles don't know what to do.
	(distname, distdir, treats, announcefile): Variables removed.
	(manifest-file): Target removed.
	(dist-dir): New target, responsible for distributable files in
	this directory.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT, TAR_VERBOSE, DIST_NAME): New variables,
	controlling the 'dist' target.
	* configure.in: Substitute GUILE-VERSION into the top-level
	Makefile.  Build doc/Makefile from doc/Makefile.in.

	* doc/Makefile.in: New file.
