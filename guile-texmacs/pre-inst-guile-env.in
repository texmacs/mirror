# Usage: pre-inst-guile-env [ARGS]

# This script arranges for the environment to support running Guile
# from the build tree.  The following env vars are modified (but not
# clobbered): GUILE_LOAD_PATH, LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH, and PATH.

# Example: pre-inst-guile-env guile -c '(display "hello\n")'
# Example: ../../pre-inst-guile-env ./guile-test-foo

# config
subdirs_with_ltlibs="srfi guile-readline"       # maintain me

# env (set by configure)
